# Elderly Activity Monitoring System

## Project Title
Elderly Activity Monitoring System using Pressure Sensor-based Foot Mat

## Research Problem Statements
With the acceleration of aging societies, the issue of the elderly living alone and the consequent loneliness-related deaths are emerging as new social problems. Despite the trend towards the development of various monitoring systems, difficulties in implementation persist due to various challenges encountered in the data collection process.

## Overview
This project proposes an elderly activity monitoring system that utilizes pressure sensors instead of conventional complex elderly monitoring systems, enabling the transmission of notification messages to smartphones.
